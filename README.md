Fizz Buzz:
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. 
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”. This can be done in either PHP or Javascript.

[Here is the program in PHP](https://github.com/njtietz/galaxE-code-test/blob/master/fizz_buzz.php)

Design Patterns:
I have a coffee shop and am hiring you to write some software to digitize my orders. The base of every beverage is either drip brewed coffee or espresso. To this base, additional ingredients are added (such as: sugar, milk, cream, steamed milk, flavor shot(s), espresso shot(s), or whipped cream) depending on the drink being made. Adding more of these ingredients will result in an incremental price increase to the beverage, as each ingredient has its own cost. My goals for digitizing the orders are to: 

  - provide my barista with a consistent experience when fulfilling orders 
  - standardize ordering and pricing for orders placed both with my cashier and those online
  - allow me to pull information to determine which ingredients are popular and which could be phased out
  
Which design patterns could be considered for implementation to solve this problem and meet these goals? Of those suggested, which would be your preference, and why?
